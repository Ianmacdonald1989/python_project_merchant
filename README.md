# Spending Tracker 
This is a application for a spending tracker app. The app should allow the user to track their spending by creating and editing merchants, tags, and transactions.

**MVP**
The MVP of the app should include the following features:

The ability to create and edit merchants

The ability to assign tags and merchants to transactions
The ability to view all transactions in a single view


Possible Extensions
The following are some possible extensions for the app:

The user should be able to mark merchants and tags as deactivated. Users will not be able to choose deactivated merchants/tags when creating a transaction.
Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project
2. Run the following command in the terminal:

# In the folder
